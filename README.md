# Text-Classification-using-Tensorflow
This project explores the development of an intelligent system that can automatically
 categorize textual content using deep learning techniques. Text classification is a key task in
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is essential for processing the vast amount of
 unstructured text generated across various platforms like reviews, emails, social media, and
 support queries. The focus is on sentiment classification using the IMDb movie reviews
 dataset, where each review is labeled as either positive or negative. The solution uses
 TensorFlow along with TensorFlow Hub to implement a neural network that integrates a pre
trained text embedding model to understand the semantic meaning of the reviews. A simple
 feedforward neural network is constructed using Keras Sequential API, trained on thousands
 of examples over multiple epochs. The model rapidly converges and achieves high accuracy
 with minimal overfitting, showing excellent generalization on unseen data. This work
 highlights the power of pre-trained embeddings in reducing complexity while delivering
 strong results in NLP tasks. It also showcases the simplicity of TensorFlow tools in building
 scalable and efficient machine learning pipelines for real-world applications.
